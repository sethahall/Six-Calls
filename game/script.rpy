#Scene 0 | Scattered, Covered, Smothered
label scene0intro:

    un "Time is meaningless, but you're on in fifteen Artie. "

    "The words rang through Arhur's head as he slowly began to wake up. "

    "His gnawing headache slowly metastising as a violent migrane. "

    "As Artie struggled to open his eyes, the world began to slowly fade in around him. "

    "As he lifted his head from the small table booth, the scene around him comes into focus."

    "The place was familiar. "

    "The room around him was littered in various signs and pictures on the wall. "

    "Three frogs hang above the Budweiser logo as sounds of the pinball fill the air. "

    "The cab itself is shitty. Based off Daytona USA, the pinball machine had clearly seen better days. "
    
    "It's been banged on by the local collegiates every semester since the place opened. "

    "Artie was never one for pinball, but a small cocktail cabinet sat glowing in the corner held a special place in his heart. "

    "The small Galaga cabinet had seen better days, but the lever itself was in pristine shape. "

    "The crown buttons on the cabinet were made for American cabinets. Compared to convex Japanese buttons, American buttons tended to be concave. "

    "Said button was clearly worn with multiple scratches on the casing."  
    
    "The switch inside was long overdue to be replaced, but arcade technicians didn't traditionally keep jobs in pizza places. "

    "Besides, there aren't many working cocktail cabinets left these days. "

    "Parts were scarce and the cabs themselves weren't the revenue drivers they once were. "

    "That being said, this cabinet meant one thing. "

    "He was at Stephanie's pizza and Stephanie's meant something to Artie. "

    "He'd spent his early years eating there during his college years. "

    "He'd spent many years eating there with his best friend Erin after dropping out of the college years. "

    "The smell of wheat crust felt like home. A small delicacy in the sea of southern cooking. "

    "Once a week during the lunch hour, the five dollar buffet opened. "

    "Rather than a set menu, the staff pick six pizzas they like and fire up the ovens. "

    "Each pie is called when it finishes. "

    "The buffet operates in rounds with the staff roating their favorites per course. " 

    "It was that smell of wheat that woke Artie. "

    "It was nostaligc. A homecoming in every sense of the word. "

    "The only problem is that Stephanie's closed two years ago. "

    "Artie had unknowingly shown up for lunch with his best friend on the final week. "

    "They'd both found out a year later. "

    "Life was kinda funny that way. "

    "As the realization began to set in, a young woman approached the table with food in hand. "

    "She placed the food down in front of them before taking a seat herself. "

    un "You know, sleeping at the table is a bit of a bad look Artie. "

    "The audacity in her voice is playful. "

    "She slides a red cup over to the table, gesturing at Artie to take it. "

    un "Your drink was free with the meal. You may wanna fill up before we get started here. "

    un "It's gonna be a pretty long talk. "

    "Artie started directly into the cup itself. These cups were commonplace when he was growing up. "

    "He'd even bought a set for his first apartment after he left to the pacific northwest. "

    "They reminded him of home. "

    ar "Yeah, gimme a second. Let me grab a drink then we can talk this out. "

    "Something was clearly off. "

    "He had no idea who this woman was or how he was standing in a building was torn down for student housing. "

    "Surreal as it was, he'd simply made peace with it. "

    "Despite his best efforts, Artie was a people pleaser. "

    "Go along to get along. "

    "As he made his way through the hall, walls of memorabilia decorated adorned the shelves around him.  "

    "There was an unhealthy amount of college football on them, but he'd figured that's just the college town life. "

    "Artie missed this place. He was so unsure of himself or where he was, but it was still comforting all the same. "

    "At the counter, their favorite granny worked the tills. "

    "The woman was the proprietor of this place. Artie and Erin used to strike up conversation with her any chance they got. "

    "The aforementioned Stefanie lived a hard life, but this place was her pride and joy. "

    "She'd once let slip that she was in her sixties to Artie and his friends, but you wouldn't think it looking at her. "

    "She rocked a leather coat and bandana while maintaining the ovens. "

    "You'd think she'd be roasting alive, but whether she was or not, the dedication to the bit was incredible. "

    "The woman took a look up from the furance as she always had when Artie stopped in. "

    "Her warm smile hid the gravel in her voice. "

    "The years of smoke, whether from the ovens or from the Marlboro Lights she smoked 3 times a day, had taken their toll. "

    "Despite this, she stepped away from the "

    "Drink in hand, Artie slowly made his way back to the table. "

    gr "Hey hon, just take care of yourself okay? "

    gr "Enjoy the food. We missed you Artie. "

    "The words of reassurance weren't lost on him. "

    "He'd been something similar in his head for years now. Toiling over what he'd have said had he known it was his last visit. "

    "All elegance was lost in him, but sometimes its the simple things that carry the most meaning. "

    ar "Thanks granny. I missed y'all too. "

    "As Artie made his way back to the table, the pit in his stomach slowly began to recede. "

    "Imagined or not, this was a small piece of closure he desperately needed. A small smile washed over his face."

    "Coke in hand, he made his way back to the table and grabbed a slice. "

    un "Feeling a little bold aren't we? "

    "He looked up from the slice. "

    un "Not even a thank you for the food or a hello. I thought your grandmother raised you better. "

    "Her words cut through Artie. Marion Caffrey was a still a sore spot for him even as more and more time passed. "

    ar "I'd really appreciate it if you didn't. "

    "His tone was bitter. There was a certain level of animosity in his voice as he ate through his feelings. "

    "There was a small look of flashed across her eyes, but it vanished as suddenly as it came. "

    un "Aw come on Artie, don't be that way. I'm just here to help out. "

    "The woman was awfully familiar with him despite the fact they'd never met. "

    "Her dark brown hair clashed against the sunlight as she took a sip of her drink. "

    "The bright orange sundress she adorned herself in was 100% in season here." 
    
    "Team colors and all that."

    "She took a slice of her own and took a small bite. "

    "The woman carried herself with a dignified air. Her words were intentional and Artie was able to pick up on it instantly. "

    "All he knew at the moment was that she was much more playful with him than he was expecting. "

    un "C'mon Artie. Say the line. I know you want too. "

    "He was wholly unfamiliar with what she was talking about and it left him at a loss. "

    "As he wracked his brain trying to remember who she was, a war was going on inside Artie. "

    "The situation was akward. His anxiety was starting to get the best of him. "

    ar "I'm really sorry, but I'm not sure what you're talking about. "

    ar "Who are you? "

    "A look flashed across her face, if only for an instant."
    
    "She was clearly hurt by the statement, but still pressed on gracefully. "

    "The woman smiled and took a sip before speaking. "

    un "I'm not surprised you forgot about me Artie. It's been five years hasn't it. "

    un "I wish this little shendig was happening under better circumstances, but we'll do our best with a fresh start. "

    un "I'm Roza. Pleasure to meet you again Arthur. "

    "Artie paused for a second. Like everything else, her name felt familiar. Somehow, they'd met. "

    "If only he could remember. The food had dulled the migrane, but not stamped it out entirely. "

    "As if in lockstep, Artie fired back. "

    ar "No, the pleasure is all mine. "

    ar "Redundant as it is, my name is Arthur. "

    ar "My friends all call me Artie and I'd love it if you did too. "

    "There was a suddent warmth in his voice and every subsquent word put a crack in the armor he shrouded himself in. "

    "Rather than fight against the absurdity of the situation, Artie choose to embrace it. "

    "If we was here in this place, it had to be for a reason right?"

    "Student housing just doesn't magically turn back into one of your safe havens overnight. "

    "'Might as well make the best of it', he thought to himself as the gravity of the situation seemed lost on him. "

    "Despite his initial reservations, Artie opened his heart to the world. "

    "When in Rome, right? "

    rz "Alright, Artie. Well, as your friend, I think its' time for us to get started. "

    rz "I'd like to start with a question for you. There's no wrong answers here, but level with me okay?"

    rz "Why do you think you're here Arthur?"

    "He paused. "

    ar "I was hoping you'd tell me. "

    "Her nose scruntched a little bit. "

    "It was clear she was trying to blow off the absurdity of the question, but the follow through wasn't quite there. "

    rz "Come on Artie. You knew it wasn't going to be that easy. "

    ar "Was worth a shot I suppose. "

    "He knew it was a losing proposition, but if anything it confirmed his previous intution. "

    "When in Rome, right?"

    ar "I suppose this has something to do with me coming home. "

    rz "You tell me Artie. Sounds like something big happened back in the midwest. "

    "There it was. "

    "Not one to beat around the bush, she went straight for the juglar. "

    "No wriggling out of this one. "

    ar "Well..."

    "He grabbed the slice in front of him and as he stared into it, the whole world drifted away. "

#Scene 1 | Rough Landing Holly
label scene1:

    "August 28th, 2015."

    "In her heart, Holly knew the call was coming. "

    "She'd been dreading it since her mother's first worried text, but its' inevitability cast a shadow over her life. "

    "Her fate was sealed the moment Arthur Caffrey came home from the Midwest.. "

    "Artie had always been troubled. "

    "Starting at sixteen, the boy became victim of abuse. "

    "Despite their best efforts, Ray and Elizabeth Caffrey had growing pains as parents. "

    "They had always been hard on Artie. He was supposed to validate failures by overcoming his own. "

    "This did not happen. "

    "At 19, her brother had dropped out of college. "

    "A cocktail of apathy and an aversion to challenge doomed his chance from the start. "

    "By 23, he was working at the same dead end job he'd left college for. "

    "Artie had spent his best years toiling away at that job to take care of take care of their grandmother. "

    "And at 27, he buried her. "

    "The Caffreys were no stranger to cancer. Their grandmother Marion had died to liver cancer."

    "Their aunt Carolyn fell victim to skin cancer. "

    "At somepoint, Holly had almost resigned to the idea that it would likely take her or Artie someday. "

    "Something broke in Artie. He no longer had a home here. "

    "He left us on his 29th birthday. "

    "Someone or something drew him to the Midwest, but it was that calling let him flourish."

    "Her brother was the happiest she'd ever seen him.  "

    "He was a successful park ranger, he had found family and he had his real family back home. "

    "Then somehow, it all come crashing down. "

    "With every call, she heard Artie slowly die on the vine. "

    "It was clear something was wrong, but Artie refused to let anyone in. "

    "He'd always defect the question and try to refocus on taking care of her. "

    "Holly had been no stranger to adversity herself. "

    "In an attempt to course correct, the Caffreys took a more free range approach with her. "

    "In some ways, this made her was jealous of the structure and plans the family had for her brother. "

    "She then watched those same plans crush the light out of his eyes. "

    "Holly took a different path. Her passion for the arts propelled her towards her dreams. "

    "At 26, she had found success with her art and had begun to entertain the idea of a public showing. "

    "Artie had been wholly supportive of her art. That support kept them close, especially over the last few years when he left. "

    "At 28, Holly had settled into a quiet life in the country. Her art was successful and she enjoyed a loving relationship with her partner. "

    "Then at 30, her brother came home."

    "Artie came and went. He'd be gone before she woke up and come home too late. He blew off his friends then kept blowing off his family. "

    "That did not work for Elizabeth Caffrey. "

    "Their mother saw Artie coming home as a second chance to help the son she'd abused. "

    "And so, the chickens had come home to roost. "

    "Despite her best efforts to pacify her mother Elizabeth, there was no way to pacify her besides this call. "

    "As if on cue, a roar erupted throughout the living room. "

    "BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR"

    "BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR"

    "As much as she'd like to, dragging this out would only belabor the point. "

    hc "Hey mom, how's your da...."

    ec "Holly, have you heard from your brother? It's been two weeks since he last called. "

    ec "I tried to reach him last night, but his phone goes straight to voicemail. "

    "Artie had always been a bit distant, but it had only gotten worse since he came home from the Midwest. "

    "It was sudden. She'd been talking to him the night before only for him to show up unannounced two days later. "

    "In the past two weeks, her brother had retreated into himself. "

    "She'd known something was off, but one way or another he'd always come home one way or another. "

    "He'd texted last week, but it felt more like decorum than an actual check-in. "

    hc "He texted me last week to check in, but I haven't spoken to him since the dinner"

    ec "Holly, has he said anything to you about what happened? "

    "There it was. "

    "Like glass shattering, the wave of realization crashed over her. "

    "Artie was keeping something from her. She'd be conscious of it, but the weight of the act had finally caught up to her. "
    
    hc "Mom, I don't know. He wouldn't tell me anything when I asked. "

    ec "Holly, he was staying with you. Please tell me something. "

    hc "Mom, I really don't know any more than you do. I'm sorry."

    "The pit in her stomach was only growing the longer the conversation went on. "

    ec "Have you spoken to any of his friends? Has Erin heard from him?"

    hc "Mom, I've not spoken to Erin in years. She was always Artie's friend more than mine. "

    "She saw the expression sink on her mother's face at those words. "

    "Elizabeth had tried her best with the two, but every failure as a parent was beginning to set in. "

    hc "Mom, listen. I'll call Erin. "

    hc "Artie always talked about his friends, so maybe they've heard from him. "

    ec "Thank you honey. I love you both so much and I'm just scared. "

    hc "Listen, it'll be okay mom. Artie always came back to us. I love you too mom. "

    "The phone clicked off as she turned to the task at hand. "

    "Artie had left her an envolope of people to contact if anything ever happened to him. "

    "She prayed she would never need to use it, but the time for that had long passed. "

    "As the envelope tore, a smell came wafting through. "

    "Artie liked to leave a bit of cologne in his letters. It helped their mom with her homesickness in the early years of his exodus. "

    "She wafted the smell in before unsealing the letter. It felt nostalgic. It was the same scent he'd worn at her wedding. "

    "As she flipped through the documents, the name she was looking for stuck out to her.  "

    "Despite the ever growing pit in her stomach, Holly began to dial the number. "

    "Each ring only amplified her anxiety. She just wanted to get this over with. "

    "Eventually, a woman's voice cut through the silence between rings. "

    er "Erin Hendricks, local personality. "

    "Erin was Artie's best friend. They'd known each other since grade school and Artie routinely introduced her as his family. "

    "If anyone could get through to him, she was on the short list. "

    "The voice itself was relaxed. Erin used it to ground the people around her. "

    hc "Erin, it's Holly Caffrey. "

    er "Holly? God, it's good to hear from you again. I haven't seen you since the last time Artie came home. "

    hc "Erin, I'm really sorry to call you out of the blue like this, but something is very wrong with Artie."
