#Scene 0 | Scattered, Covered, Smothered
label scene0intro:

    un "Time is meaningless, but you're on in fifteen Artie. "

    "The words rang through Arthur's head as he slowly began to wake up. "

    "His gnawing headache slowly metastising as a violent migrane. "

    "As Artie struggled to open his eyes, the world slowly came into picture. "

    "The room around him was littered in various signs and pictures on the wall. "

    "Three frogs hung above the Budweiser logo as sounds of the pinball filled the air. "

    "The pinball machine itself is shitty. Based off Daytona USA, it had absolutely seen better days. "
    
    "It had been banged on by the local collegiates every semester since the place opened. "

    "Artie was never one for pinball, but the small cocktail cabinet glowing in the corner held a special place in his heart. "

    "The small Galaga machine had seen better days, but the lever itself was in pristine shape. "

    "The buttons on the cabinet were made for American cabinets." 

    "He could tell by the fact they were convex."

    "Said button had been clearly worn with multiple scratches on the casing."  
    
    "The switch inside was long overdue to be replaced, but pizza shops didn't tend to hire arcade technicians. "

    "These machines were difficult to be serviced. "

    "Parts were scarce and the cabs themselves weren't the revenue drivers they once were. "

    "Not this guy though. . "
    
    "Still fully operational, the splash screen howled in the distance. "

    "The faded speakers still had a little bass in them, but time had clearly taken its' toll. "

    "The world had stopped turning. "

    "Time truly was meaningless here. "

    "He knew this because he was at Stefano's. " 

    "This was home. "

    "The smell of wheat crust heralded memories of a better time. Combined with a sweeter sauce, Stefano's pizza had a distinctive taste. "
    
    "It was a small delicacy in the sea of biscuits and fried chicken joints. "

    "Once a week during the lunch hour, the five dollar buffet opened. "

    "Rather than a set menu, the staff pick six pizzas they like and fire up the ovens. "

    "Each pie is called when it finishes. "

    "The buffet operates in rounds with the staff roating their favorites in and out of the various courses. "

    "He'd missed this. " 

    "It was nostaligc. A homecoming in every sense of the word. "

    "The only problem is that Stephanie's closed two years ago. "

    "Artie had unknowingly shown up for lunch with his best friend on the final week. "

    "It had always been their spot throughout their tumultuous years. "

    "They'd both found out a year later in a way that served as a reminder that life could be kinda funny sometimes. "

    "As the waves of realization began to slowly crash upon his shores, someone had begun to approach. "

    "She placed the food down in front of them before taking a seat herself. "

    un "You know, sleeping at the table is a bit of a bad look Artie. "

    "The audacity in her voice is playful. "

    "She slides a red cup over to the table, gesturing at Artie to take it. "

    un "Your drink was free with the meal. You may wanna fill up before we get started. "

    un "This is gonna take a few minutes. "

    "Artie started directly into the cup as the pangs in his stomach satiated themselves. "
    
    "Like everything else, these cups reminded him of home just as much as the arcade machine in the corner. "

    ar "Yeah, gimme a second. I suppose I'll grab somethin'. "

    "Even his accent had come back. A slight southern drawl had creeped back in. "

    "Something was clearly off. "

    "He had no idea who this woman was or how he was standing in a building was torn down for student housing. "

    "Surreal as it was, he'd simply made peace with it. "

    "Despite his best efforts, Artie was a people pleaser. "

    "Go along to get along. "

    "As he made his way through the hall, walls of memorabilia decorated adorned the shelves around him.  "

    "There was an unhealthy amount of college football on them, but he'd figured that's just the college town life. "

    "At the counter, his second favorite granny worked the tills. "

    "The Pizza Granny ran this place. Artie and friends made a game of trying to figure out her connection to the place. "

    "The woman had lived a hard life, but this place was her pride and joy. "

    "She'd once let slip that she was in her sixties to Artie and his friends, but you wouldn't think it looking at her. "

    "For better or worse, it was clear that her rebellion years weren't exactly a phase. "

    "She rocked a leather coat and bandana while maintaining the ovens. "

    "Underneath her leather drapery, the woman's arms were covered in tattoos from the should down. "

    "You'd think she'd be roasting alive in all that garb, but regardless, the dedication to the bit was incredible. "

    "The woman looked up from the furance as she always had when Artie stopped by. "

    "Her warm smile masked the gravel in her voice. "

    "Be it by over or by Marlboro light, a warm smile masked the gravel in her voice. "

    gr "Hey hon, it's good to see you back after all these years. "

    gr "We got some stuff on the menu since you were last here. "
    
    gr "Just a heads up. They may not play nice with some dietary constraints. "

    gr "Go ahead and give it a look if you haven't. "

    "As Artie made his way back to the table, the pit in his stomach slowly receded. "

    "Imagined or not, this was a small piece of closure he desperately needed. A small smile washed over his face."

    "Coke in hand, he made his way back to the table and grabbed a slice. "

    un "Feeling a little bold aren't we? "

    "He looked up from his food as if instinctively. "

    un "Not even a thank you for the food or a hello. I thought your grandmother raised you better. "

    "Her words cut through Artie. " 
    
    "The passing of grandmother, Marion Caffrey, never left the man's mind. "

    ar "I'd really appreciate it if you didn't. "

    "The tone was bitter as he attempted to mask his contempt by eating his feelings. "

    "The venom from his eyes left almost as soon as it had arrived. "

    "His grandmother HAD raised him better than this. "

    "Both of them exchanged a parting look of guilt before composing themselves. "

    "As if nothing ever happened, a measure of playfullness returned to the woman's voice. "

    un "I'm really sorry Artie, but I promise I'm just here to help out. "

    "She'd felt oddly familiar and he'd felt a sincerity in her voice.  "

    "Artie wanted to believe she meant well. "

    "It was a very southern way of teasing and lord knows he'd seen worse throughout his lifetime. "

    "She took a slice of her own and took a small bite. "

    "The teasing began to continue. "

    un "C'mon Artie. Say the line. I know you want to. "

    "He had no idea what she was talking about. "

    "The situation was akward at best, disaster at worse."
    
    "His anxiety started to boil over. "

    ar "Listen, I uh...."

    ar "I'm really sorry, but I'm not sure what you're talking about. "

    ar "Who are you? "

    "The dour look flashed again."

    "As if in opposition, she continued to carry herself with an air of grace. "
    
    un "Oh how rude of me. "

    un "I'm Rozlin. Pleasure to meet you Arthur. "

    "Artie paused for a second. Much like this place, there was something about her that he couldn't quite put his finger on. "

    "His head was still spinning. The food had dulled the migrane, but not stamped it out entirely. "

    "But, as if possed by the ghost of every southern white woman, Artie fired back with the same level of sincerity he'd been met with. "

    ar "No, the pleasure is all mine. "

    ar "Redundant as it is, my name is Arthur. "

    ar "My friends all call me Artie and I'd love it if you did too. "

    "There was warmth in his voice alongside the crack in the armor he shrouded himself in. "

    "The small gesture of kindness served to remind Artie of the person he was. "

    "Rather than fight against the absurdity of the situation, Artie choose to embrace it. "

    rz "Alright, Artington. Let's try this again. "

    rz "No wrong answers here, but try to level with me?"

    rz "Why do you think you're here Arthur?"

    "He paused. "

    "Artie had been dreading the question since she sat down. "

    "There was absolutely a reason he was here. "

    "Dead pizza places don't magically spring back to life and Artie hadn't added passing out to his daily routine. "

    "This woman wasn't beating around the bush either. "

    "..."

    "He bit into a slice in front of him in an attempt to combat the newly returned pit in his stomach. "

    ar "This is about my homecoming, right? "

#Scene 1 | Rough Landing Holly
label scene1:

    "August 28th, 2015."

    "In her heart, Holly knew the call was coming. "

    "She'd been dreading it since her mother's first worried text, but its' inevitability cast a shadow over her life. "

    "Her fate was sealed the moment Arthur Caffrey returned home from the Midwest. "

    "Something was wrong with Artie. He had his share of troubles, but this was something different. "

    "Both Elizabeth and Holly had been excited to see him, but the person who walked through the door barely resembled Artie. "

    "Over the first few days, he locked himself away in his room. Sneaking out at random intervals to eat, shower and change clothes. "

    "If he wasn't locked up in his room, he was locked in the driver's seat of his car. "

    "His friends called it his security blanket and he wasn't inclined to disagree. "

    "It was more of a home than the single bedroom aparatment in Chicago ever could be. "

    "Artie came and went, all while continuously dodging questions about why he came home. "

    "This did not work for their mother. "

    "Despite their best efforts, Ray and Elizabeth Caffrey went through multiple growing pains as parents. "

    "They'd always been hard on Artie. He was supposed to validate their failures by overcoming his own. "

    "That did not happen. "

    "At nineteen, he'd dropped out of college. "

    "A cocktail of apathy and an aversion to challenge doomed his chances from the start. "

    "By twenty-three, he was working at the same dead end job he'd left college for. "

    "The only upside at this time came from taking care of his grandmother. "

    "This woman practically raised him. He was her pride and joy. "

    "She was the guiding light in his life, and he'd bury her at twenty-seven. "

    "Their grandmother Marion had died of liver cancer."

    "Their aunt Carolyn would pass from skin cancer five years later. "

    "The Caffreys were no stranger to cancer, but Marion's passing destroyed Artie. "

    "With the guiding light in his life gone, Artie began to dream of elsewhere. "

    "Someone or something drew him to the Midwest, but it was that calling let him flourish."

    "He'd been the happiest she'd ever seen him.  "

    "His job with the forrestry service gave him a sense of accomplishment and his found family gave him the a community to thrive in. "

    "Both of them made sure to stay in constant contact, but as of late, their communications were sparse. "

    "His mood nosedived from call to call. "

    "It was clear something was wrong, but Artie wouldn't let anyone in. "

    "He was constantly dodging their questions. "

    "It was especially frustrating considering that Holly was no stranger to adversity either. "

    "In an attempt to course correct, the Caffreys took a more free range approach with her. "

    "In some ways, she wished for the same structure and plans the family had for her brother. "

    "Then she watched the weight of their family's expectations crush him. "

    "This took Holly down a different path. "
    
    "The lack of structure meant that her possibilities were endless. "

    "At twenty-six, she'd found success an artist and began to entertain the idea of an art show. "

    "Artie had always been supportive of her art. That support kept them close, especially over the last few years when he left. "

    "At twenty-eight, Holly had settled into a quiet life in the country off her art. "

    "Then at thirty, her brother came home."

    "Despite her best efforts to pacify her, Holly knew there was no way to dodge this call with her mother. "

    "As if on cue, a roar erupted throughout the living room. "

    "BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR"

    "BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR"

    "As much as she'd like to, dragging this out would only belabor the point. "

    hc "Hey mom, how's your da...."

    ec "Holly, have you heard from your brother? It's been two weeks since he last called. "

    ec "I tried to reach him last night, but his phone goes straight to voicemail. "

    "Artie had always been a bit distant, but it had only gotten worse in the since he came home from the Midwest. "

    "It was all so sudden. "

    "One minute she was talking to him on the phone and the next he was sleeping on her couch. "

    "She'd known something was off, but one way or another he'd always come home one way or another. "

    "He'd texted last week, but it felt more like decorum than an actual check-in. "

    hc "He texted me last week to check in, but I haven't spoken to him since the dinner"

    ec "Holly, has he said anything to you about what happened? "

    "There it was. "

    "Like glass shattering, the wave of realization crashed over her. "

    "Artie was keeping something from her. She was conscious of it, but the weight of the act had finally caught up to her. "
    
    hc "Mom, I don't know. He wouldn't tell me anything when I asked. "

    ec "Holly, he was staying with you. Please tell me something. "

    hc "Mom, I really don't know any more than you do. I'm sorry."

    "The pit in her stomach was only grew the longer the conversation went on. "

    ec "Have you spoken to any of his friends? Has Erin heard from him?"

    hc "Mom, I've not spoken to Erin in years. She was always Artie's friend more than mine. "

    "The expression sunk on her mother's face at those words. "

    hc "Mom, listen. I'll call Erin. "

    hc "She's his best friend so maybe she's seen him. "

    ec "Thank you honey. I love you both so much and I'm just scared. "

    hc "Listen, it'll be okay mom. He always comes home. "

    ec "Love you a bushel and a peck, sweetheart. "

    hc "I love you too mom. "

    "The phone clicked off as she turned to the task at hand. "

    "Artie'd left her an envolope of people to contact in case anything ever happened to him. "

    "She prayed it would never come to that, but the time for that had long since passed. "

    "As the envelope tore, the smell of cologne came wafting through. "

    "The scent belonged to Artie. He liked to let a small droplet soak into the envelope."
    
    "It was a small piece of comfort for both Holly and Elizabeth. "

    "The fragrence was nostalgic. It'd been the same scent he'd worn at her wedding. "

    "As she flipped through his letters, the name she was looking for stuck out to her as she began to text the number. "

    "Erin worked for the local radio station so calling her outright was difficult. "

    hc "Hey Erin, it's Holly. "

    "The response back arrived quicker than anticpated. "

    er "Hey kiddo, it's been a minute. You doing okay? "

    "It had been a few years since they'd last spoken. Artie was her main exposure to Holly, and he left to the midwest."

    hc "Hey Erin, listen I know you're on break, but can you give me a call when you're off work? "

    er "Absolutely. Is everything okay? "

    "Her anxiety spiked for a moment. If Holly was texting her then it was probably about Artie. "

    "She hadn't heard from him in over a month.  "

    hc "Oh yeah, I just heard you over the radio and wanted to check-in.  "

    "Erin takes a sigh of relief before firing back. "

    er "Sounds good, Holly. I'll call you after work. It's gonna be pretty late. "

    er "That okay with you? "    

    hc "Absolutely. See you then!"

    "Firing off the response, the anxiety welled up like a pit in her stomach. "

    "Erin traditionally took three or four callers before her break. "

    "Holly was going to have to make due in the meantime. "

    "Hours pass in anticipation. "

    "As the hours passed, she began to worry that Erin had forgotten to call back."

    "As if on queue, her phone began to vibrate. "

    "Each ring only amplified her anxiety. She just wanted to get this over with. "

    "Eventually, a woman's voice cut through the silence between rings. "

    er "Hey Holly,. "

    "Erin was Artie's best friend. They'd known each other since grade school and Artie routinely introduced her as his family. "

    "If anyone could get through to him, she was on the short list. "

    "The voice itself was relaxed. Erin used it to ground the people around her. "

    hc "Hey Erin. I'm really sorry to call you out of the blue like this, but something is very wrong with Artie."

#Scene 2 | By the Way
label scene2:
    #Erin Hendricks 

    #Fade in on a painted shot from the view of the Sharp's Ridge radio station. Go take this picture to help Shelby.

    "The radio star is alive and well in Knoxville. "

    "Traditionally a quiet town, the space under the mountain provides the perfect area to broadcast. "

    "Atop Sharp's Ridge, the WNFZ broadcasted to the greater Knoxville metropolitan area. "

    "Starting as WATO-FM, the studio debuted as a college station focused on progressive rock. "

    "In its adolescent years, WATO-FM transitioned WUUU as an attempt to provide easy listening to the sleepy valley. "

    "The market for easy listening would eventually be cornered by B97.5 due to the strength of its' aggressive marketing campaigns. "

    "WUUU was deemed a failure."

    "After another rebrand, WUUU became 94.3 The X and Knoxville finally had a place for the alternative. "

    "94.3 belted its' hard rock and heavy metal hits to the quiet valley. "

    "Erin Hendricks grew up with the X. "

    "The WEEK NIGHT AD-FREE SIX PACK came on just as she'd got off from her old restaurant job and kept her sane on the ride home. "

    "Now she's their voice. "

    "Nested alongside the analog dials, the bright red glow of the On Air sign perforated the darkness. "

    "This was her show and it was time to go live. "

    #Scene shifts to a close in shot of a woman's lips in front of an on air mic. 

    er "Ladies and Gentleman, that was our first song of the night. "

    er "Welcome to 94.3, THE X. Knoxville's rock destination. "

    er "I am Erin Hendricks, your one and only mistress of the airwaves. "

    er "It's Friday night and you know what that means. "

    er "That's right dear caller, tonight we are going to hear from you. "

    er "I've got one more track for you and then we'll start the calls. "

    "The track began to play as Erin took a sip from her coke. "

    "Being the mistress of the airwaves came with its' toll on her throat sometimes, but soft fizz of her drink kept everything humming. "

    "She'd ordered pizza as everything was queued up for an easy shift. "

    "The smell of grease and cheese wafted into the air as she took the first slice. "

    "The slice was from the good pizza place down on Cumberland Avenue. "

    "That one was extra special since the student workers liked to go heavy handed on the toppings. "

    "They'd once even humored a request for a pizza with four orders of pepperoni for her and Artie. "

    "It was just one of their spots. "

    "The memories were bittersweet, but the opportunity to remain lost in nostalgia began to fade alongside the final verse. "

    "Showtime. "

    er "Welcome back to 94.3 The X. Knoxville's home for alternative and hard rock. "

    er "While its' ladies night every night, tonight is for a few lucky callers. "

    er "Caller number one, how are we doing tonight? "

    "The caller's voice catches her off guard. The man's voice sounds like a deflating tire. "

    "His words are eaten by static and the ones that come through have a nasally inflection on the caller's voice. "

    ca "Big fan. 1st time caller. The boys down here at Reasonable Ron's Used Tire tune in every night."

    er "Well you know we love our fans here every night. "

    er "Talk to me, caller number one. This is your moment to shine. "

    "The small inflection projected is an act of kindness in the face of this man's caucauphonus static.  "

    "As if on cue, the man's voice cut back in. "

    ca "You believe in ghosts ma'am? "

    "The man's drawl was overpowering. The vocal equivalent of cigarette smoke on your clothes. "

    er "Can't say I do, but I'm assuming you do? "

    "The man made a small cough before continuing. The energy in his voice slowly began to fade as he struggled to muster up the courage to speak. "

    ca "Well, I live out here down Tazwell Pike. Across from that big 'ol graveyard. "

    ca "The other night I was sittin' outside my porch drinking a Bud until this scratching noise came out of nowhere. "

    ca "I figured it was some kinda raccoon, but eventually it started hollerin' this ungodly wail. "

    "Clearly it wasn't a raccoon. "

    "It could have been black bear that made its' way down from the mountains. "

    "The bear population had slowly begun to move inwards towards civilization after years of tourists leaving scraps out for them. "

    ca "I went inside to go get my hunting rifle. Figured whatever was out there might be ornery. "

    ca "So I sit back outside and watch the cemetary for movement. "

    ca "Couple of teens got caught up there a few weeks back and I figured they might've come back. "

    ca "So, I just called my cousin Big Jim Bob. He's real lonely after the divorce.  "

    ca "Some ball and chain she turned out to be. "

    "A look of disgust crossed across her face. "

    "Sexism from customers wasn't exactly uncommon, but it still got a pretty harsh reaction of her. "
    
    er "Listen to me caller number one, if I hear you say anything else like that tonight then I'm cutting your mic. "

    ca "Well, all I'm saying is his words. "

    ca "As I was saying, Big Jim Bob was real upset about the divorce so we to talking. "

    ca "I'm telling him things like 'You were too good for her' and he's just sitting there. "

    ca "He didn't take too kindly to that one. "

    ca "We start cussin' up a storm until this noise hits the side of my shed. "

    er "What'd that sound like to you? I'm thinking maybe the kids came back, or maybe even a bear?"

    er "You know they get real frisky this time of year. "

    "As the attention turned back to him, a level of uncertainty began to fade into the man's voice, "

    ca "It sounded like someone trying to bulldoze the house. "

    ca "I got around outside and there wasn't no nothing there. "

    ca "I'm telling you that siding was perfect. Looked as good as the day I painted it. "

    ca "So I'm out here thinking one of the kids just smashed into the house or something else. "

    ca "But back to Big Jim Bob. You know my hearts is just breaking for 'em. "

    ca "I remember him back when he was Little Jim Bob. We go back a....."

    er "Don't leave me hanging here, caller number one. What happened with the house? "

    ca "Right. "

    ca "So come back onto the porch and figure I'll just sit a bit. "

    ca "See if I can't bust me some teenagers. "

    ca "Waited an hour or so and heard nothing. "

    ca "Did a quick tour 'round the house too. "

    ca "Saw nothin. "

    ca "Went inside and just crawled into bed. "

    ca "Got woken up about an hour later by the dog barking. "

    ca "My pug, Dolly, gets real anxious around noises at night and lord she was yappin'. "

    ca "So I get up, I check the house. Check the porch. "

    ca "Still a whole lotta nothing. "

    ca "Been some weird stuff happening around town. "

    "Barring the sexism, this was exactly what Erin was looking for. "

    "Friday nights never seemed to dissapoint. "

    er "Well caller number one, we've run out of time, but tell me one lsat thing. "

    er "What would you like to hear tonight? "

    ca "Y'all got any Creedance? "

    er "Sorry, caller number one. We're fresh out, but is there anything else that strokes your fancy? "

    ca "Lemme get some of that Megadeth. "

    er "It's coming right up, caller number one.  "

    er "And a big thank you for calling in to your mistress of the airwaves over here at 94.3 THE X. "

    "As she popped the disk into the system, a wave of relief washed over her. "

    "Time between tracks meant break time and break time meant more pizza. "

    "With the automated ad reads, she was looking at a good fifteen minute break.  "

    "Yet despite her excitement over the call, the caller's other comments clung to her. "

    "Erin let loose a huge sigh and made her way back to her food. "

    "The tension from her shoulders briefly allowed to relax. "

    "As much as she loved the program, the worst of Knoxville sure loved to call. "

    "The call lines at the station drew all sorts of people with all sorts of ideas. "

    "As frustrating as it could be, Friday nights were only once week and tended to go well. "

    "And even if they didn't, she still had four shows the rest of the week to restore the feeling. "

    "Regardless, that was future Erin's problem and a hot slice of pizza begged her to live in the now. "

    "As if on queue, her personal phone lit up. "

    "Holly had texted her. "

    "As if by instinct, she clicked over to the phone and keyed out her message. "

    er "Hey kiddo, it's been a minute. You doing okay? "

    "It had been a few years since they'd last spoken. Artie was her main exposure to Holly and Artie left fot the midwest."

    hc "Hey Erin, listen I know you're on break, but can you give me a call when you're off work? "

    er "Absolutely. Is everything okay? "

    "Her anxiety spiked for a moment. If Holly was texting her then it was probably about Artie. "

    "She hadn't heard from him in over a month.  "

    hc "Oh yeah, I just heard you over the radio and wanted to check-in.  "

    "Erin takes a sigh of relief before firing back. "

    er "Sounds good, Holly. I'll call you after work. It's gonna be pretty late. "

    er "That okay with you? "

    hc "Absolutely. See you then!"

    "The anxiety began to fall off as the precious minutes of her break came to an end. "

    "She carried the half-eaten slice with her on the way back to the recording booth. "

    "You see, some things are just sacred and this slice was crafted in god's image. "

    "With the ad break over, it was time to go back to work. "

    er "Welcome back to our program ladies and gentlemen. We've got time for a few more callers. "

    "As if on queue, the light on the mixer begam to flash as a new caller came on the line. "

    er "Well, would ya look at that? Welcome to the program, caller number two. "

    er "So tell me..."

    "She left a brief pause in between lines. "

    er "What do you wanna talk about tonight with your mistress of the late night. "

    ca "Howdy ma'am. "

    "The man's drawl came in with just enough gravel to be legible and manners that would make the priesthood blush. "

    ca "Well, since you're the indlugin' type, I'd love to talk movies with you. "

    "Erin perked at the suggestion. "

    er "That sounds real lovely there, darlin'. "

    er "Whatcha watchin'? Tell about something special, caller number two. "

    "She heard the man choke up a bit at being called darlin'. "

    ca "So, I watched this movie the other night. "

    ca "Title escapes me at the moment, but I can remember the rest clear as day. "

    ca "See there's this feller driving round the highways at night lookin' real hurt. "

    ca "Somethin' about him just feels lost in the roads.  "

    ca "I remember thinking to myself, 'Gosh, that sure does sound like me.', but I suppose that's neither here nor there. "

    ca "There's this long scene of just drivin'. Coulda swore I saw a sign for the Smokies in there too. "

    ca "Them trees were beautiful. "

    ca "They laid a red and gold bouquet at the foothills of the mountain. "

    ca "Now I've never been a god fearing man, but lord help me, those leaves felt like a blessing from above. "

    "She could feel his enthusiasm as it crept into every last word. "

    "Something had clearly stuck with the man, and she wanted to know more. "

    "There were signs of life in this call. "

    "So maybe, just maybe, this'll be an all-timer. "

    er "Tell me more, caller number two. "

    "The man clears his voice as the gravel sets in. "

    ca "It's just real particular. There's something in the trees. "

    ca "Can't put my finger on it, but I know it's out there. "

    "The uncertainty in his voice hides a bit of fear. Depending on the sign, those trees could be anywhere within a thirty mile radius. "

    "He takes another moment to clear his throat, before swiftly jumping topics."

    ca "I keep coming back here. Not just the trees, but the highways too. "

    ca "There's something just striking about the open roads at night. "

    ca "It's like the whole world gives way to the stars. "

    ca "You just don't get that view down here in the city. It's like we're kept blind to the world outside us. "

    ca "I'd like to think its' a message from above, but I just don't know. "

    ca "There's a whole lot I don't know.  "

    ca "Only thing I know is that feller in the car never comes home. "

    ca "The highways come knocking for the despondent. "

    ca "It doesn't matter if you're looking for a fresh start. It doesn't matter if you're looking to get away from the world. "

    ca "The highway calls us all.  "

    "He takes another moment to clear his throat. "

    ca "You know, I've talked about this film a whole lot. "

    ca "Can't say its for everyone, but there's something there for me. "

    ca "Sometimes when I'm alone, I like to think the highways are my home. "

    ca "It sure feels better than the one I'm at. "

    ca "What do you do when home is supposed to feel like home, but it don't feel like home anymore? "

    "The man caught himself one last time. "

    ca "Suppose that's all I've got tonight. "

    er "Thank you caller number two. Easily my best call of the night. "

    er "I'll pray you find a good home. "

    "A bit of levity returns to the man's voice. You'd almost think he's blushing over the phone. "

    ca "Well ma'am, that is certainly kinder than I deserve. You have a good night, ya hear? "

    er "You too, caller number two. "

    "With that, she hung up. "

    "There was time for one more caller, but before that, it was time for another track. "

    "This time was dealer's choice and she had just the thing. "

    er "Ladies and Gentleman of the night, this one goes out to a very special friend of the show. "

    ""

    "The night was basically over. "

    "The remaining tasks were automated as ad reads are sandwiched between a set playlist. "

    "The rest of the pizza had gotten cold, but she packed an extra slice for herself. "

    "Clearly content with her work, it was time to wind down. "

    "As if on queue, the alarm on her phone reminded her of the only thing between her and a nice bath. "

    "Holly had called earlier, and Erin had yet to call back. "

    "Something felt off with Holly. "
    
    "The phone barely managed to croak out her ringtown before the crushed voice of Holly Caffrey came on the line. "

    hc "Hey Erin, I'm sorry for calling you out of the blue like this. "

    er "Don't worry about it. It's just good to hear from you. "

    "Holly's voice began to crack. She wasn't as prepared for this as expected, but who ever is? "

    "The phone rings a few times, and prior to this outing, Erin answers immediately. "

    hc "Hey Erin. I'm really sorry to call you out of the blue like this, but something is very wrong with Artie."
