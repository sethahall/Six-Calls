#Scene 0 | Scattered, Covered, Smothered
label scene0intro:

    un "Time is meaningless, but you're on in fifteen Artie. "

    "The words rang through Arthur's head as he slowly began to wake up. "

    "His gnawing headache slowly metastising as a violent migrane. "

    "As Artie struggled to open his eyes, the world slowly came into picture. "

    "The room around him was littered in various signs and pictures on the wall. "

    "Three frogs hung above the Budweiser logo as sounds of the pinball filled the air. "

    "The pinball machine itself is shitty. Based off Daytona USA, it had absolutely seen better days. "
    
    "It had been banged on by the local collegiates every semester since the place opened. "

    "Artie was never one for pinball, but the small cocktail cabinet glowing in the corner held a special place in his heart. "

    "The small Galaga machine had seen better days, but the lever itself was in pristine shape. "

    "The buttons on the cabinet were made for American cabinets." 

    "He could tell by the fact they were convex."

    "Said button had been clearly worn with multiple scratches on the casing."  
    
    "The switch inside was long overdue to be replaced, but pizza shops didn't tend to hire arcade technicians. "

    "These machines were difficult to be serviced. "

    "Parts were scarce and the cabs themselves weren't the revenue drivers they once were. "

    "Not this guy though. . "
    
    "Still fully operational, the splash screen howled in the distance. "

    "The faded speakers still had a little bass in them, but time had clearly taken its' toll. "

    "The world had stopped turning. "

    "Time truly was meaningless here. "

    "He knew this because he was at Stefano's. " 

    "This was home. "

    "The smell of wheat crust heralded memories of a better time. Combined with a sweeter sauce, Stefano's pizza had a distinctive taste. "
    
    "It was a small delicacy in the sea of biscuits and fried chicken joints. "

    "Once a week during the lunch hour, the five dollar buffet opened. "

    "Rather than a set menu, the staff pick six pizzas they like and fire up the ovens. "

    "Each pie is called when it finishes. "

    "The buffet operates in rounds with the staff roating their favorites in and out of the various courses. "

    "He'd missed this. " 

    "It was nostaligc. A homecoming in every sense of the word. "

    "The only problem is that Stephanie's closed two years ago. "

    "Artie had unknowingly shown up for lunch with his best friend on the final week. "

    "It had always been their spot throughout their tumultuous years. "

    "They'd both found out a year later in a way that served as a reminder that life could be kinda funny sometimes. "

    "As the waves of realization began to slowly crash upon his shores, someone had begun to approach. "

    "She placed the food down in front of them before taking a seat herself. "

    un "You know, sleeping at the table is a bit of a bad look Artie. "

    "The audacity in her voice is playful. "

    "She slides a red cup over to the table, gesturing at Artie to take it. "

    un "Your drink was free with the meal. You may wanna fill up before we get started. "

    un "This is gonna take a few minutes. "

    "Artie started directly into the cup as the pangs in his stomach satiated themselves. "
    
    "Like everything else, these cups reminded him of home just as much as the arcade machine in the corner. "

    ar "Yeah, gimme a second. I suppose I'll grab somethin'. "

    "Even his accent had come back. A slight southern drawl had creeped back in. "

    "Something was clearly off. "

    "He had no idea who this woman was or how he was standing in a building was torn down for student housing. "

    "Surreal as it was, he'd simply made peace with it. "

    "Despite his best efforts, Artie was a people pleaser. "

    "Go along to get along. "

    "As he made his way through the hall, walls of memorabilia decorated adorned the shelves around him.  "

    "There was an unhealthy amount of college football on them, but he'd figured that's just the college town life. "

    "At the counter, his second favorite granny worked the tills. "

    "The Pizza Granny ran this place. Artie and friends made a game of trying to figure out her connection to the place. "

    "The woman had lived a hard life, but this place was her pride and joy. "

    "She'd once let slip that she was in her sixties to Artie and his friends, but you wouldn't think it looking at her. "

    "For better or worse, it was clear that her rebellion years weren't exactly a phase. "

    "She rocked a leather coat and bandana while maintaining the ovens. "

    "Underneath her leather drapery, the woman's arms were covered in tattoos from the should down. "

    "You'd think she'd be roasting alive in all that garb, but regardless, the dedication to the bit was incredible. "

    "The woman looked up from the furance as she always had when Artie stopped by. "

    "Her warm smile masked the gravel in her voice. "

    "Be it by over or by Marlboro light, a warm smile masked the gravel in her voice. "

    gr "Hey hon, it's good to see you back after all these years. "

    gr "We got some stuff on the menu since you were last here. "
    
    gr "Just a heads up. They may not play nice with some dietary constraints. "

    gr "Go ahead and give it a look if you haven't. "

    gr "We missed you Artie. "

    "The words of reassurance weren't lost on him. "

    ar "Thank you ma'am. I missed y'all too. "

    "As Artie made his way back to the table, the pit in his stomach slowly receded. "

    "Imagined or not, this was a small piece of closure he desperately needed. A small smile washed over his face."

    "Coke in hand, he made his way back to the table and grabbed a slice. "

    un "Feeling a little bold aren't we? "

    "He looked up from his food as if instinctively. "

    un "Not even a thank you for the food or a hello. I thought your grandmother raised you better. "

    "Her words cut through Artie. " 
    
    "The passing of grandmother, Marion Caffrey, never left the man's mind. "

    ar "I'd really appreciate it if you didn't. "

    "The tone was bitter as he attempted to mask his contempt by eating his feelings. "

    "The venom from his eyes left almost as soon as it had arrived. "

    "His grandmother HAD raised him better than this. "

    "Both of them exchanged a parting look of guilt before composing themselves. "

    "As if nothing ever happened, a measure of playfullness returned to the woman's voice. "

    un "I'm really sorry Artie, but I promise I'm just here to help out. "

    "She'd felt oddly familiar and he'd felt a sincerity in her voice.  "

    "Artie wanted to believe she meant well. "

    "It was a very southern way of teasing and lord knows he'd seen worse throughout his lifetime. "

    "She took a slice of her own and took a small bite. "

    "The teasing began to continue. "

    un "C'mon Artie. Say the line. I know you want to. "

    "He had no idea what she was talking about. "

    "The situation was akward at best, disaster at worse."
    
    "His anxiety started to boil over. "

    ar "Listen, I uh...."

    ar "I'm really sorry, but I'm not sure what you're talking about. "

    ar "Who are you? "

    "The dour look flashed again."

    "As if in opposition, she continued to carry herself with an air of grace. "
    
    un "Oh how rude of me. "

    un "I'm Rozlin. Pleasure to meet you Arthur. "

    "Artie paused for a second. Much like this place, there was something about her that he couldn't quite put his finger on. "

    "His head was still spinning. The food had dulled the migrane, but not stamped it out entirely. "

    "But, as if possed by the ghost of every southern white woman, Artie fired back with the same level of sincerity he'd been met with. "

    ar "No, the pleasure is all mine. "

    ar "Redundant as it is, my name is Arthur. "

    ar "My friends all call me Artie and I'd love it if you did too. "

    "There was warmth in his voice alongside the crack in the armor he shrouded himself in. "

    "The small gesture of kindness served to remind Artie of the person he was. "

    "Rather than fight against the absurdity of the situation, Artie choose to embrace it. "

    rz "Alright, Artington. Let's try this again. "

    rz "No wrong answers here, but try to level with me?"

    rz "Why do you think you're here Arthur?"

    "He paused. "

    "Artie had been dreading the question since she sat down. "

    "There was absolutely a reason he was here. "

    "Dead pizza places don't magically spring back to life and Artie hadn't added passing out to his daily routine. "

    "This woman was not beating around the bush as went at his jugular. "

    "He bit into a slice in front of him in an attempt to combat the newly returned pit in his stomach. "

    ar "This has something to do with me coming home, doesn't it? "

#Scene 1 | Rough Landing Holly
label scene1:

    "August 28th, 2015."

    "In her heart, Holly knew the call was coming. "

    "She'd been dreading it since her mother's first worried text, but its' inevitability cast a shadow over her life. "

    "Her fate was sealed the moment Arthur Caffrey returned home from the Midwest.. "

    "He'd always been troubled. "

    "Despite their best efforts, Ray and Elizabeth Caffrey had growing pains as parents. "

    "They had always been hard on Artie. He was supposed to validate failures by overcoming his own. "

    "This did not happen. "

    "At nineteen, he'd dropped out of college. "

    "A cocktail of apathy and an aversion to challenge doomed his chances from the start. "

    "By twenty-three, he was working at the same dead end job he'd left college for. "

    "Artie spent his twenties taking care of their grandmother. "

    "He'd bury her at twenty-seven."

    "The Caffreys were no stranger to cancer. Their grandmother Marion had died to liver cancer."

    "Their aunt Carolyn fell victim to skin cancer. "

    "Holly was resigned to the idea that it would likely one of them too. "

    "Her brother had been dejected in the aftermath of her passing. "

    "It wasn't too long after that Arthur began to dream of elsewhere. "

    "Someone or something drew him to the Midwest, but it was that calling let him flourish."

    "Arthur took to his new home instantly. "

    "He'd been the happiest she'd ever seen him.  "

    "His job with the forrestry service gave him a sense of accomplishment and his found family gave him the a community to thrive in. "

    "Both of them made sure to stay in constant contact, but something started to change in Artie. "

    "His mood begun to nosedive. "

    "Each call increased in severity. "

    "It was clear something was wrong, but Artie refused to let anyone in. "

    "He'd always deflect by refocusing the question back on her. "

    "Holly Caffrey was no stranger to adversity as well. "

    "In an attempt to course correct, the Caffreys took a more free range approach with her. "

    "In some ways, she wished for the same structure and plans the family had for her brother. "

    "Then she watched the weight of her familie's collective failure crush him. "

    "This took Holly down a different path. "
    
    "The lack of structure meant that her possibilities were endless. "

    "At twenty-six, she'd found success an artist and began to entertain the idea of an art show. "

    "Artie had always been supportive of her art. That support kept them close, especially over the last few years when he left. "

    "At twenty-eight, Holly had settled into a quiet life in the country off her art. "

    "Then at thirty, her brother came home."

    "Artie came and went from the house, continuously dodging questions about why he was home. "

    "This did not work for mother, Elizabeth Caffrey. "

    "Despite her best efforts to pacify her, Holly knew there was no way to dodge this call. "

    "As if on cue, a roar erupted throughout the living room. "

    "BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR"

    "BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR"

    "As much as she'd like to, dragging this out would only belabor the point. "

    hc "Hey mom, how's your da...."

    ec "Holly, have you heard from your brother? It's been two weeks since he last called. "

    ec "I tried to reach him last night, but his phone goes straight to voicemail. "

    "Artie had always been a bit distant, but it had only gotten worse in the since he came home from the Midwest. "

    "It was all so sudden. "

    "One minute she was talking to him on the phone and the next he was sleeping on her couch. "

    "She'd known something was off, but one way or another he'd always come home one way or another. "

    "He'd texted last week, but it felt more like decorum than an actual check-in. "

    hc "He texted me last week to check in, but I haven't spoken to him since the dinner"

    ec "Holly, has he said anything to you about what happened? "

    "There it was. "

    "Like glass shattering, the wave of realization crashed over her. "

    "Artie was keeping something from her. She was conscious of it, but the weight of the act had finally caught up to her. "
    
    hc "Mom, I don't know. He wouldn't tell me anything when I asked. "

    ec "Holly, he was staying with you. Please tell me something. "

    hc "Mom, I really don't know any more than you do. I'm sorry."

    "The pit in her stomach was only grew the longer the conversation went on. "

    ec "Have you spoken to any of his friends? Has Erin heard from him?"

    hc "Mom, I've not spoken to Erin in years. She was always Artie's friend more than mine. "

    "The expression sunk on her mother's face at those words. "

    hc "Mom, listen. I'll call Erin. "

    hc "She's his best friend so maybe she's seen him. "

    ec "Thank you honey. I love you both so much and I'm just scared. "

    hc "Listen, it'll be okay mom. He always comes home. "

    ec "Love you a bushel and a peck, sweetheart. "

    hc "I love you too mom. "

    "The phone clicked off as she turned to the task at hand. "

    "Artie'd left her an envolope of people to contact in case anything ever happened to him. "

    "She prayed it would never come to that, but the time for that had long since passed. "

    "As the envelope tore, the smell of cologne came wafting through. "

    "Artie liked to leave a bit of cologne in his letters. It helped their mom with her homesickness in the early years of his exodus. "

    "It felt nostalgic. It was the same scent he'd worn at her wedding. "

    "As she flipped through the documents, the name she was looking for stuck out to her as she began to dial the number. "

    "Each ring only amplified her anxiety. She just wanted to get this over with. "

    "Eventually, a woman's voice cut through the silence between rings. "

    er "Erin Hendricks, local personality. "

    "Erin was Artie's best friend. They'd known each other since grade school and Artie routinely introduced her as his family. "

    "If anyone could get through to him, she was on the short list. "

    "The voice itself was relaxed. Erin used it to ground the people around her. "

    hc "Erin, it's Holly Caffrey. "

    er "Holly? God, it's good to hear from you again. I haven't seen you since the last time Artie came home. "

    hc "Erin, I'm really sorry to call you out of the blue like this, but something is very wrong with Artie."
